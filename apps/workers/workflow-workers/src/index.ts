/*
 * BullMQ worker with simple job routing.
 *
 * To start the worker locally:
 *   pnpm dev:worker
 *
 * Jobs in this file:
 * - Load all necessary environment variables
 * - Manage worker lifecycle (start, stop, shutdown)
 * - Attach worker to a specific queue
 * - Worker should run "handler" on receiving a job
 * - Handle graceful shutdown of worker when receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM
 *   - Worker should complete existing job and stop receiving new jobs before shutting down
 * - Setup event listeners
 */
