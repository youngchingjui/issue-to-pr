/*
 * BullMQ worker with simple job routing.
 *
 * To start the worker locally from root directory:
 *   pnpm dev:workflow-workers
 *
 * Jobs in this file:
 * - Manage worker lifecycle (start, stop, shutdown), including graceful shutdown of worker when receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM
 * - Attach worker to a specific queue
 * - Attach "handler" to the worker
