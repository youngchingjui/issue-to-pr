# Implementation Plan for Streaming Responses

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps needed to implement real-time streaming responses from the `commentOnIssue` workflow to the front-end client, based on the architecture defined in Architecture.md.

## Staged Implementation

To break down this complex implementation into manageable, testable pieces, we will follow these stages:

**Goal**: Create simplest possible streaming UI with mock data

**Components**:

1. Basic StreamHandler component âœ…
   - Simple text display area âœ…
   - Start/Stop button âœ…

   - Implemented in `components/StreamHandler.tsx`
   - Features:
     - Real-time text streaming simulation
     - Clean UI with Tailwind CSS
     - Proper cleanup on unmount
     - Error handling support
     - Completion callback
2. Demo page âœ…
   - Mount StreamHandler âœ…
   - Show streaming status âœ…
   - Implemented in `app/demo/page.tsx`
   - Features:
     - Clean layout
     - Error and completion handlers
     - Workflow ID display

**Testing**: âœ…

### Stage 2: Basic Backend + Real SSE (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Replace mocks with real streaming infrastructure

**Components**:

1. Basic WorkflowEventEmitter

   - Progress indicator
   - Feedback buttons
   - Different message types (progress, error, complete)
2. Enhanced WorkflowEventEmitter

   - State management
   - Error recovery
3. Interactive demo workflow
   - Accepts user input
   - Responds to feedback
   - Shows progress

**Testing**:

### Stage 4: Full Integration (3-4 days)

**Goal**: Complete production implementation

**Components**:

1. GitHub Integration
   - Real commentOnIssue workflow
   - GitHub API integration
   - Full error handling
2. Production UI
   - Professional styling
   - Complete interactive features
   - Error boundaries
3. Production Features

Each stage builds on the previous one and provides a working demo that showcases the new functionality. We can use mock data and simplified implementations in early stages to get quick feedback and validation before adding complexity.

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Existing Components

1. **Backend Workflows**

   - `commentOnIssue.ts`: Main workflow for generating issue comments
   - `resolveIssue.ts`: Workflow for resolving issues

2. **Frontend Components**

   - `IssueActions.tsx`: Handles issue-related actions
   - `PRActions.tsx`: Handles PR-related actions
   - `GitHubItemDetails.tsx`: Displays GitHub item details

3. **API Routes**
   - `/api/comment/route.ts`: Handles comment generation
   - `/api/review/route.ts`: Handles PR reviews
   - `/api/workflow/[workflowId]/route.ts`: Placeholder for workflow events

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks

1. âœ… Memory leaks from unclosed connections (Addressed with cleanup mechanisms)
2. âœ… Race conditions in event handling (Addressed with proper state management)
3. Browser compatibility issues
4. Performance degradation with many concurrent streams

### Mitigation

1. âœ… Implement proper cleanup mechanisms
2. âœ… Add connection timeouts
