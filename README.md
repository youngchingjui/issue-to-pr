## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- pnpm (required) - We use pnpm for its significant advantages:
  - Much faster installation than npm
  - Efficient disk space usage through content-addressable storage
  - Strict dependency management preventing phantom dependencies
  - Dramatically improved CI/CD build times
- Redis server

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](docs/setup/getting-started.md).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project. See [Configuration Guide](docs/setup/getting-started.md#configuration) for all available options.

Basic configuration:

```env
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

### Development Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
