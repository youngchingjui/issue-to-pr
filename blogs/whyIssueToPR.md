# Why Issue to PR? A Developer's Dream of Seamless Automation

Issue To PR is an AI tool that automatically converts GitHub issues into pull requests by analyzing your codebase, implementing fixes, and creating PRs with proper descriptions and tests.

## How It Works

When you have a GitHub issue, Issue To PR reads the problem description, analyzes your repository to understand the codebase structure, identifies the files that need changes, implements the fix, runs tests, and creates a pull request with detailed explanations.

## Transparent Process

You can see exactly what the AI is doing at each step. It shows its analysis, reasoning, and decision-making process. You can intervene at any point to modify the approach or provide additional guidance.

## Developer Control

You remain in control throughout the process. You can pause the workflow, review proposed changes before implementation, provide constraints or additional context, and approve or reject any step.

## Speed and Quality

What typically takes hours of context switching, analysis, coding, and PR creation now happens in minutes. The generated PRs include proper descriptions, linked references, test results, and clear explanations of changes.

## GitHub Integration

Built using GitHub's APIs and security model. Works with your existing repository permissions, branching strategies, and development workflow without requiring changes to your process.

## Bottom Line

Issue To PR automates the repetitive parts of bug fixing while keeping developers in control of the important decisions. It reduces context switching and saves time without compromising code quality or security.
