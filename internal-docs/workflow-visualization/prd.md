# Workflow Visualization PRD

## Problem Statement

### Context

- Current workflow execution data is difficult to understand and debug
- Users need a clear visual representation of workflow execution
- Complex relationships between workflow events are hard to trace
- No easy way to explore the full context of workflow execution

### Impact

- Developers spend excessive time debugging workflow issues
- Understanding workflow execution requires manual log parsing
- Difficult to identify patterns and optimize workflow performance
- Limited ability to share and collaborate on workflow debugging

## User Stories

### Core Visualization

```
As a developer
I want to see a graph-based visualization of workflow execution
So that I can understand the flow and relationships between events
```

### Node Exploration

```
As a developer
I want to explore different types of workflow nodes
So that I can understand the specific role and impact of each event
```

### Relationship Analysis

```
As a developer
I want to see relationships between workflow events
So that I can understand causal and sequential connections
```

### Content Preview

```
As a developer
I want to preview and expand node content
So that I can access detailed information when needed
```

## Implementation Plan

### Implementation Strategy

#### Pragmatic, Data-Driven Approach

Our implementation strategy focuses on iterative improvements to existing components rather than building new infrastructure from scratch. This approach:

1. **Builds on Existing Code**

   - Enhances the current `WorkflowRunDetail` component
   - Leverages existing Neo4j data structure and relationships
   - Uses current workflow event types and data models
   - Implements modular component architecture for maintainability

2. **Component Architecture**

   - Base EventCard component for consistent UI/UX
   - Event-specific components for specialized display
   - Shared utilities for common operations
   - Popover system for detailed views
   - Clear separation of concerns between components

3. **Event Type Implementation**

   - LLM Response: Focused on content readability
   - Tool Call: Clear parameter visualization
   - Tool Response: Structured data display
   - Error: High-visibility error states
   - Default: Graceful handling of unknown types

4. **Iterative Feature Development**

   - Start with modular component structure ✓
   - Add event-specific improvements gradually ✓
   - Implement real-time updates on existing UI
   - Add advanced features based on actual usage patterns

This strategy ensures we:

- Deliver value quickly
- Minimize technical debt
- Base decisions on real usage patterns
- Maintain existing functionality while adding features

     workflowId: string
     data: Record<string, unknown>
     timestamp: Date
     metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
   }

   // Event types
   type WorkflowEventType =
     | "workflow_start"
     | "llm_response"
     | "tool_call"
     | "tool_response"
     | "error"
     | "complete"
