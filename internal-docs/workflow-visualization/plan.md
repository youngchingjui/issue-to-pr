# Workflow Visualization Planning Document

## Today's Tasks

### 1. Documentation Restructuring

#### Directory Changes ✓

Directory structure has been implemented:

```
/internal-docs
├── issue-to-pr/
│   └── user-stories.md
├── neo4j-implementation/
│   └── stages.md
├── workflow-visualization/
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── user-stories.md
└── templates/
    └── prd-template.md
```

### 2. Documentation Content Updates ✓

- Requirements have been consolidated and updated in PRD
- User stories have been updated with new requirements
- Technical specifications documented

### 3. Technical Requirements Documentation ✓

- Node Types Display Requirements documented
- Relationship Visualization requirements documented
- UI/UX Specifications documented

### 4. Implementation Planning

#### Immediate Tasks (This Week)

- [ ] Enhance Existing Workflow Visualization

  - [ ] Add visual timeline/graph view to `WorkflowRunDetail`
    - [ ] Start with simple left-to-right timeline
    - [ ] Show event relationships using arrows
    - [ ] Color-code different event types
  - [ ] Improve event type displays
    - [ ] Create specific card layouts for each event type
    - [ ] Add syntax highlighting for code in tool calls
    - [ ] Show LLM responses in a more readable format
  - [ ] Add interactive features to existing UI
    - [ ] Implement zoom and pan for large workflows
    - [ ] Add collapsible sections for long content
    - [ ] Enable quick navigation between related events

- [ ] Real-time Updates
  - [ ] Add WebSocket connection to existing component
  - [ ] Implement live updates for active workflows
  - [ ] Show loading states for pending events

#### Phase 1: UI/UX Improvements (Week 1)

- [ ] Event Type-Specific Enhancements

  - [ ] Design and implement LLM response card
  - [ ] Create tool call visualization with params
  - [ ] Add error state highlighting
  - [ ] Show workflow completion summary

- [ ] Navigation and Interaction
  - [ ] Add workflow search and filtering
  - [ ] Implement event type filtering
  - [ ] Add timestamp-based navigation
  - [ ] Create workflow comparison view

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 2)

- [ ] Graph View Implementation

  - [ ] Add optional graph view toggle
  - [ ] Implement basic node layout
  - [ ] Show relationships between events
  - [ ] Enable node expansion/collapse

- [ ] Performance Optimization
  - [ ] Implement pagination for large workflows
  - [ ] Add lazy loading for event details
  - [ ] Optimize WebSocket updates
  - [ ] Cache frequently accessed data

## Questions to Resolve

1. Graph Layout

   - Which layout algorithm best suits our needs?
   - How to handle large workflows?
   - How to visualize parallel branches effectively?

2. Performance

   - What's the expected maximum number of nodes?
   - When should we load full content vs previews?
   - What's our caching strategy for node content?

3. Interaction
   - How do we best show different relationship types?
   - How should node expansion work in the graph context?
   - What navigation patterns work best for large graphs?

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Begin technical implementation planning
2. [ ] Research and select graph visualization library
3. [ ] Set up Neo4j schema and persistence layer
4. [ ] Implement basic event tracking
5. [ ] Begin WebSocket integration for real-time updates

## Notes

- Implementation details are kept in `/internal-docs`
- Public documentation is kept in `/docs`

## Future Considerations

### Additional Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement monitoring metrics:
  - Event storage latency
  - Query performance
  - Storage growth
  - Relationship depth
  - Error rates

### Event Handling and Real-time Features

- [ ] Plan support for parallel execution branches
- [ ] Set up connection management
- [ ] Implement event replay mechanism

### Research Tasks

- Research and evaluate different graph visualization libraries
- Investigate optimal node positioning algorithms
- Study best practices for graph layout algorithms
- Analyze performance implications of different visualization approaches

### Technical Debt Items

- [ ] Original routing update tasks:
  - Update all parameter references in codebase from `traceId` to `workflowId`
  - Ensure backward compatibility during transition
- [ ] Service naming considerations:
  - Evaluate alternatives: `WorkflowService`, `WorkflowStateManager`, `WorkflowEventStore`
  - Document service responsibilities and interfaces
