# Workflow Visualization Planning Document

## Today's Tasks

### 1. Documentation Restructuring

#### Directory Changes ✓

Directory structure has been implemented:

```
/internal-docs
├── issue-to-pr/
│   └── user-stories.md
├── neo4j-implementation/
│   └── stages.md
├── workflow-visualization/
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── user-stories.md
└── templates/
    └── prd-template.md
```

### 2. Documentation Content Updates ✓

- Requirements have been consolidated and updated in PRD
- User stories have been updated with new requirements
- Technical specifications documented

### 3. Technical Requirements Documentation ✓

- Node Types Display Requirements documented
- Relationship Visualization requirements documented
- UI/UX Specifications documented

### 4. Implementation Planning

#### Immediate Tasks

- [ ] Update name of `WorkflowPersistenceService` to better reflect its role
  - Current location: `lib/services/WorkflowPersistenceService.ts`
  - Consider: `WorkflowService`, `WorkflowStateManager`, `WorkflowEventStore`
- [ ] Update routing parameter name in workflow pages
  - Change from `traceId` to `workflowId`
  - Update: `app/workflow-runs/[traceId]/page.tsx` → `app/workflow-runs/[workflowId]/page.tsx`
  - Update all parameter references in codebase

#### Phase 1: Core Graph Structure

- [ ] Research and select graph visualization library
- [ ] Plan basic node-edge structure
- [ ] Define node positioning algorithm requirements
- [ ] Specify basic node styling approach
- [ ] Set up Neo4j schema for workflow events
- [ ] Implement event persistence layer
- [ ] Create query optimizations for common paths

#### Phase 2: Node Type Implementation

- [ ] Design base node component structure
- [ ] Plan specific node type implementations
- [ ] Design preview system
- [ ] Plan expandable content system
- [ ] Implement event type handling:
  - workflow_start
  - llm_complete
  - tool_call
  - tool_response
  - error
  - complete

#### Phase 3: Real-time Updates and Relationships

- [ ] Design relationship visualization approach
- [ ] Plan interactive features
- [ ] Design relationship type indicators
- [ ] Plan support for parallel execution branches
- [ ] Implement WebSocket server
- [ ] Create event buffering system
- [ ] Set up connection management
- [ ] Implement event replay mechanism

#### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Plan lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Design virtualization for large graphs
- [ ] Define render performance optimizations
- [ ] Plan caching mechanisms
- [ ] Implement monitoring metrics:
  - Event storage latency
  - Query performance
  - Storage growth
  - Relationship depth
  - Error rates

## Questions to Resolve

1. Graph Layout

   - Which layout algorithm best suits our needs?
   - How to handle large workflows?
   - How to visualize parallel branches effectively?

2. Performance

   - What's the expected maximum number of nodes?
   - When should we load full content vs previews?
   - What's our caching strategy for node content?

3. Interaction
   - How do we best show different relationship types?
   - How should node expansion work in the graph context?
   - What navigation patterns work best for large graphs?

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Begin technical implementation planning
2. [ ] Research and select graph visualization library
3. [ ] Set up Neo4j schema and persistence layer
4. [ ] Implement basic event tracking
5. [ ] Begin WebSocket integration for real-time updates

## Notes

- Implementation details are kept in `/internal-docs`
- Public documentation is kept in `/docs`
