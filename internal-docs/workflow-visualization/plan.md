# Workflow Visualization Planning Document

## Today's Tasks

### 1. Documentation Restructuring

#### Directory Changes ✓

Directory structure has been implemented:

```
/internal-docs
├── issue-to-pr/
│   └── user-stories.md
├── neo4j-implementation/
│   └── stages.md
├── workflow-visualization/
│   ├── prd.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── user-stories.md
└── templates/
    └── prd-template.md
```

### 2. Documentation Content Updates ✓

- Requirements have been consolidated and updated in PRD
- User stories have been updated with new requirements
- Technical specifications documented

### 3. Technical Requirements Documentation ✓

- Node Types Display Requirements documented
- Relationship Visualization requirements documented
- UI/UX Specifications documented

### 4. Implementation Planning

#### Phase 1: Core Graph Structure

- [ ] Research and select graph visualization library
- [ ] Plan basic node-edge structure
- [ ] Define node positioning algorithm requirements
- [ ] Specify basic node styling approach

#### Phase 2: Node Type Implementation

- [ ] Design base node component structure
- [ ] Plan specific node type implementations
- [ ] Design preview system
- [ ] Plan expandable content system

#### Phase 3: Relationships and Interactions

- [ ] Design relationship visualization approach
- [ ] Plan interactive features
- [ ] Design relationship type indicators
- [ ] Plan support for parallel execution branches

#### Phase 4: Performance Considerations

- [ ] Plan lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Design virtualization for large graphs
- [ ] Define render performance optimizations
- [ ] Plan caching mechanisms

## Questions to Resolve

1. Graph Layout

   - Which layout algorithm best suits our needs?
   - How to handle large workflows?
   - How to visualize parallel branches effectively?

2. Performance

   - What's the expected maximum number of nodes?
   - When should we load full content vs previews?
   - What's our caching strategy for node content?

3. Interaction
   - How do we best show different relationship types?
   - How should node expansion work in the graph context?
   - What navigation patterns work best for large graphs?

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Begin technical implementation planning
2. [ ] Research and select graph visualization library
3. [ ] Create proof of concept for basic graph structure
4. [ ] Implement initial node types
5. [ ] Begin relationship visualization development

## Notes

- Implementation details are kept in `/internal-docs`
- Public documentation is kept in `/docs`
