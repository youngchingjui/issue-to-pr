# Workflow Visualization Planning Document

## Today's Tasks

### 1. Documentation Restructuring

#### Directory Changes

- [ ] Create new root-level directory `/internal-docs` with structure:

  ```
  /internal-docs
  ├── user-stories/
  │   └── workflow-visualization.md
  ├── prd/
  │   └── workflow-visualization/
  │       ├── prd.md
  │       └── plan.md (this file)
  ├── templates/
  │   └── prd-template.md
  └── planning/  (to be removed/merged into prd/)
      └── workflow-visualization/
          ├── plan.md
          └── implementation/
              ├── workflow-event-tracking.md
              └── workflow-visualization.md
  ```

#### File Movements

Using `git mv` to preserve history:

- [ ] Move `/docs/guides/user-stories/workflow-visualization.md` to `/internal-docs/user-stories/workflow-visualization.md`
- [ ] Move `/docs/internal/planning/implementation/workflow-event-tracking.md` to `/internal-docs/prd/workflow-visualization/implementation/workflow-event-tracking.md`
- [ ] Move `/docs/internal/planning/implementation/workflow-visualization.md` to `/internal-docs/prd/workflow-visualization/implementation/workflow-visualization.md`
- [ ] Move this file to `/internal-docs/prd/workflow-visualization/plan.md`

#### New Files to Create

- [ ] Create `/internal-docs/templates/prd-template.md`
  - Standard sections: Problem Statement, User Stories, Technical Requirements, Implementation Plan, Success Metrics
  - Include examples and guidelines for each section
- [ ] Create `/internal-docs/prd/workflow-visualization/prd.md`
  - Based on existing user stories
  - Updated with new graph-based visualization requirements
  - Include technical specifications for different node types
  - Document relationship mapping requirements

### 2. Documentation Content Updates

#### Resolve Conflicts in Requirements

- [ ] Review and compare requirements between:
  - Current user stories in `workflow-visualization.md`
  - Implementation details in `workflow-event-tracking.md`
  - Implementation details in `workflow-visualization.md`
  - New graph-based visualization requirements

#### Update User Stories

In `/docs/user-stories/workflow-visualization.md`:

- [ ] Add new user story for graph-based visualization
- [ ] Update "Exploring Node Relationships" story with new requirements
- [ ] Add story about node type-specific displays
- [ ] Add story about content preview/expansion

### 3. Technical Requirements Documentation

#### Node Types Display Requirements

Document display requirements for each WorkflowEventType:

- [ ] workflow_start: Minimal presence, background styling
- [ ] llm_response: Prominent, collapsible, preview with full content expansion
- [ ] tool_call: Prominent, tool name, parameters preview
- [ ] tool_response: Medium prominence, result preview
- [ ] error: High visibility, error indication
- [ ] complete: Clear completion indicator

#### Relationship Visualization

- [ ] Document types of relationships:
  - Sequential (next event)
  - Causal (which node triggered which)
  - Parallel execution branches
- [ ] Define visual representation for each relationship type
- [ ] Specify interaction patterns for relationship exploration

#### UI/UX Specifications

- [ ] Node expansion/collapse behavior
- [ ] Content preview system design
- [ ] Full content view specifications
- [ ] Visual hierarchy documentation
- [ ] Interaction patterns documentation

### 4. Implementation Planning

#### Phase 1: Core Graph Structure

- [ ] Research and select graph visualization library
- [ ] Plan basic node-edge structure
- [ ] Define node positioning algorithm requirements
- [ ] Specify basic node styling approach

#### Phase 2: Node Type Implementation

- [ ] Design base node component structure
- [ ] Plan specific node type implementations
- [ ] Design preview system
- [ ] Plan expandable content system

#### Phase 3: Relationships and Interactions

- [ ] Design relationship visualization approach
- [ ] Plan interactive features
- [ ] Design relationship type indicators
- [ ] Plan support for parallel execution branches

#### Phase 4: Performance Considerations

- [ ] Plan lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Design virtualization for large graphs
- [ ] Define render performance optimizations
- [ ] Plan caching mechanisms

## Questions to Resolve

1. Graph Layout

   - Which layout algorithm best suits our needs?
   - How to handle large workflows?
   - How to visualize parallel branches effectively?

2. Performance

   - What's the expected maximum number of nodes?
   - When should we load full content vs previews?
   - What's our caching strategy for node content?

3. Interaction
   - How do we best show different relationship types?
   - How should node expansion work in the graph context?
   - What navigation patterns work best for large graphs?

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Get approval on directory restructuring plan
2. [ ] Create PRD template
3. [ ] Begin documentation reorganization
4. [ ] Update user stories with new requirements
5. [ ] Create comprehensive PRD for workflow visualization
6. [ ] Begin technical implementation planning

## Notes

- All file moves should use `git mv` to preserve history
- New documentation should follow the PRD template once created
- Implementation details should be kept in `/internal-docs`
- Public documentation should be kept in `/docs`
