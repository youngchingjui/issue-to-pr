# Workflow Visualization User Stories

This document outlines the user stories for the workflow visualization feature, which allows users to understand and interact with the LLM agent workflows in the system.

## Core User Stories

### 1. Viewing Workflow History

**As a** user  
**I want to** see a visual representation of the workflow steps that have been executed  
**So that** I can understand how the LLM agent processed my request

Acceptance Criteria:

- User can see a chronological list of events in the workflow
- Each event shows its type (message, tool call, decision point)
- Events are connected to show their relationships
- Timestamps are displayed for each event
- The current status of the workflow is clearly indicated

### 2. Understanding Agent Decisions

**As a** user  
**I want to** see the reasoning behind each agent's decision  
**So that** I can understand why certain actions were taken

Acceptance Criteria:

- Each decision point shows the agent's thought process
- Alternative paths that were considered are visible
- The factors that influenced the decision are displayed
- Links between decisions and resulting actions are clear
- Users can expand/collapse detailed reasoning

### 3. Exploring Node Relationships

**As a** user  
**I want to** explore how different nodes in the workflow relate to each other  
**So that** I can understand the complex interactions in the system

Acceptance Criteria:

- Users can click on nodes to see their relationships
- Different types of relationships are visually distinct
- Users can filter relationships by type
- The direction of relationships is clearly shown
- Users can zoom in/out of the relationship view

### 4. Real-time Workflow Updates

**As a** user  
**I want to** see the workflow update in real-time as the agent works  
**So that** I can monitor progress and understand what's happening

Acceptance Criteria:

- New nodes appear immediately when created
- Current active node is highlighted
- Users can see when new relationships are formed
- Status changes are reflected in real-time
- Users can tell if a workflow is active or completed

### 7. Event Type Distinction

**As a** user  
**I want to** easily distinguish between status updates and interactive events  
**So that** I can focus on the important decision points in the workflow

Acceptance Criteria:

- Status events are displayed in a compact, timestamp-first format
- Timestamps are right-aligned in a fixed column on the left
- Timestamps only shown when different from previous event (by second)
- Status messages use consistent checkmark icon
- Status messages are grouped when consecutive
- All status messages use muted styling for visual consistency
- Interactive events remain card-based with full interaction controls
- Clear visual hierarchy between status and interactive events
- Status messages show local time without millisecond precision
- Grid layout ensures consistent alignment across all status messages

### 8. Error Handling and Recovery

**As a** user  
**I want to** clearly see when and why errors occur in the workflow  
**So that** I can understand and potentially resolve issues

Acceptance Criteria:

- Error states are immediately visible with distinct styling
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Tool registration errors show which tool was not found
- Error cards show relevant context for debugging
- Errors don't break the overall workflow visualization
- Error states persist in the workflow history
- Recovery options are presented when available
- Error logging helps with debugging

### 9. Tool Call Understanding

**As a** user  
**I want to** see tool call parameters directly in the event card  
**So that** I can understand the tool's usage without additional interaction

Acceptance Criteria:

- Tool parameters are visible in the event card
- Parameters are properly formatted and readable
- Complex parameters can be expanded
- Parameter hierarchy is clear
- Content stays within card boundaries

### 9. Data Structure Clarity

**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a properly structured event data model  
**So that** I can efficiently query and analyze workflow patterns

Acceptance Criteria:

- Events have clear relationships in Neo4j
- Data model supports efficient querying
- Event hierarchy is properly represented
- Metadata is consistently structured
- Indexes are optimized for common queries

## Future Considerations

### 5. Workflow Analytics

**As a** user  
**I want to** see analytics about workflow patterns and performance  
**So that** I can optimize and improve the system

Acceptance Criteria:

- View common paths through workflows
- See timing statistics for different steps
- Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies
- Compare performance across different workflows
- Export analytics data for further analysis

### 6. Workflow Intervention

**As a** user  
**I want to** be able to intervene in active workflows when needed  
**So that** I can guide or correct the agent's actions

Acceptance Criteria:

- Ability to pause workflows at decision points
- Option to provide additional input to agents
- Capability to redirect workflow paths
- Clear indication of manual interventions in the visualization
- Audit trail of user interventions
