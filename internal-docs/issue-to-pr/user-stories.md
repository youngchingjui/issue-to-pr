# User Stories: Issue to PR Workflow

## Core User Story

As a developer, I want to resolve GitHub Issues with AI assistance so that I can quickly generate high-quality pull requests while maintaining full control over the process.

## Detailed User Stories

### 1. Issue Resolution Initiation

As a developer, I want to:

- Click a "Resolve Issue" button on any GitHub Issue
- See a real-time interactive interface showing the AI agent's workflow
- Have the option to stop or pause the process at any time

### 2. AI Agent Transparency

As a developer, I want to:

- See the AI agent's thought process in real-time
- View what files and code sections the AI is analyzing
- Understand what changes the AI is proposing and why
- See a clear chain of reasoning for each decision
- Have visibility into any external resources or documentation the AI is referencing

### 3. Interactive Collaboration

As a developer, I want to:

- Add course-correcting comments at any point in the process
- Provide additional context when the AI agent needs it
- Choose from suggested next actions rather than typing everything
- Override or modify any AI-proposed changes
- Guide the AI's focus to specific areas of the codebase
- Add constraints or requirements that weren't in the original issue
- Share relevant documentation or code examples that might help the AI
- Clarify ambiguous requirements or technical constraints
- Provide historical context about past related changes
- Suggest specific approaches or patterns to follow
- Flag potential edge cases or concerns early in the process
- Highlight dependencies or related components the AI should consider
- Add business context or domain-specific knowledge
- Correct any misunderstandings in the AI's assumptions
- Participate in key decision points during the resolution process

### 4. Change Management

As a developer, I want to:

- See a preview of all proposed changes before they're committed
- Review diffs of file modifications in real-time
- Approve or reject individual changes
- Add comments or suggestions to specific code sections
- Request alternative approaches for any proposed change

### 5. Pull Request Generation

As a developer, I want to:

- Have a complete, well-formatted pull request generated automatically
- See a clear title and description that references the original issue
- Review a comprehensive list of changes made
- Have appropriate labels and reviewers automatically added
- See testing and validation results before the PR is created
- Have the option to modify the PR details before submission

### 6. Quality Assurance

As a developer, I want to:

- See automated test results for all changes
- Get linting and code style validation
- Receive security scanning results
- Have documentation updates included where necessary
- See performance impact assessments for changes
- Get suggestions for additional tests that should be added

### 7. Review Process

As a developer, I want to:

- See a clear summary of all changes made
- Have important code sections highlighted
- Get explanations for why each change was made
- Have the context from the original issue clearly linked
- Be able to easily review the AI's thought process that led to each change
