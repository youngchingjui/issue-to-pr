# User Stories: Workflow Run with Content Review

## Core User Story

As a developer, I want to review and control AI-generated content before it's published to GitHub, so that I can ensure quality and prevent unintended side effects while maintaining the benefits of AI assistance.

## Detailed User Stories

### 1. Workflow Configuration

As a developer, I want to:

- Configure auto-publication settings for different content types (comments, PRs)
- Enable/disable testing mode for development purposes
- Set default preferences for workflow behavior
- Have my preferences persisted across sessions

### 2. Content Generation

As a developer, I want to:

- Initiate AI workflows from GitHub issues
- See real-time progress of content generation
- Have content saved as drafts before publication
- Access a history of generated content
- Cancel content generation if needed

### 3. Content Review

As a developer, I want to:

- Review AI-generated content before publication
- See a preview of how content will appear on GitHub
- Edit generated content if needed
- Add additional context or modifications
- Compare different versions of generated content
- Understand the AI's reasoning for generated content

### 4. Publication Control

As a developer, I want to:

- Explicitly approve content before it's published
- Choose when to publish approved content
- Batch approve/publish multiple items
- Discard draft content that I don't want to use
- Retry content generation with modified parameters
- Roll back published content if needed

### 5. Testing Mode

As a developer, I want to:

- Run workflows in testing mode without affecting GitHub
- See exactly what would be published
- Test different AI parameters and settings
- Generate multiple versions for comparison
- Have a clear indication that I'm in testing mode

### 6. Content Management

As a developer, I want to:

- View all my draft content in one place
- Filter drafts by status (pending review, approved, discarded)
- Search through draft content
- Bulk manage draft content
- Archive old drafts
