# Workflow Visualization PRD

## Problem Statement

### Context

- Current workflow execution data is difficult to understand and debug
- Users need a clear visual representation of workflow execution
- Complex relationships between workflow events are hard to trace
- No easy way to explore the full context of workflow execution

### Impact

- Developers spend excessive time debugging workflow issues
- Understanding workflow execution requires manual log parsing
- Difficult to identify patterns and optimize workflow performance
- Limited ability to share and collaborate on workflow debugging

## User Stories

### Core Visualization

```
As a developer
I want to see a graph-based visualization of workflow execution
So that I can understand the flow and relationships between events
```

### Node Exploration

```
As a developer
I want to explore different types of workflow nodes
So that I can understand the specific role and impact of each event
```

### Relationship Analysis

```
As a developer
I want to see relationships between workflow events
So that I can understand causal and sequential connections
```

### Content Preview

```
As a developer
I want to preview and expand node content
So that I can access detailed information when needed
```

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                     | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Performance issues with large workflows  | High   | Medium     | Implement virtualization and lazy loading |
| Complex graph layouts becoming confusing | High   | Medium     | Careful UX design and user testing        |
| Browser compatibility issues             | Medium | Low        | Cross-browser testing and polyfills       |
| Memory leaks in graph rendering          | High   | Low        | Regular performance profiling and testing |
