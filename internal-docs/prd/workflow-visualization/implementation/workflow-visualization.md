# Workflow Visualization Implementation Guide

## TODO

### Guidelines for this TODO list:

- Do not write implementation code in this document
- Always specify complete file paths for easy reference
- Keep tasks specific and actionable

### Tasks:

- [ ] Update name of `WorkflowPersistenceService` to something better and more suitable

  - Current location: `lib/services/WorkflowPersistenceService.ts`
  - Consider names that better reflect its role in managing workflow state and events
  - Potential names: `WorkflowService`, `WorkflowStateManager`, `WorkflowEventStore`

- [ ] Update routing parameter name in workflow pages
  - Current: Using `traceId` in dynamic routes
  - Change to `workflowId` to better reflect the data model
  - Files to update:
    - `app/workflow-runs/[traceId]/page.tsx` â†’ `app/workflow-runs/[workflowId]/page.tsx`
    - Update all references to this parameter in the codebase

## Architecture Overview

### Data Storage

- Neo4j database for storing workflow data and relationships
- Schema optimized for quick traversal and relationship queries
- Real-time event buffering for performance

### Real-time Updates

- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Event buffering and batching for performance
- Connection recovery and event replay mechanisms

### Visualization Components

- Graph visualization for workflow relationships
- Timeline view for chronological progression
- Interactive node exploration interface
- Analytics dashboard components

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Neo4j Integration

- Set up workflow event schema
- Implement event persistence layer
- Create query optimizations for common paths
- Establish indexing strategy

### 2. Real-time Updates

- WebSocket server implementation
- Event buffering system
- Connection management
- Event replay for missed updates

### 3. Relationship Exploration

- Interactive node selection
- Relationship filtering
- Zoom and pan controls
- Performance optimizations for large graphs

### 4. Analytics Implementation

- Data aggregation pipelines
- Performance metrics collection
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Export functionality

### 5. Intervention System

- Workflow pause mechanisms
- User input handling
- Path redirection logic
- Audit logging

## Performance Considerations

- Batch updates for large workflows
- Lazy loading for historical data
- Client-side caching strategies
- Server-side query optimization

## Security

- Access control for workflow data
- Audit logging for interventions
- Data encryption in transit
- Authentication for WebSocket connections
