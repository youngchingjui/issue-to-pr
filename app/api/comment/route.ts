// This route calls a workflow that uses an LLM to understand a Github issue,
// Explore possibilities, understand the codebase,
// Then generates a post as a comment on the issue.
// The comment should include the following sections:
// - Understanding the issue
// - Possible solutions
// - Relevant code
// - Suggested plan
