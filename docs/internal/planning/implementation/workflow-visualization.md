# Workflow Visualization Implementation Guide

This document outlines the technical implementation details for the workflow visualization feature.

## Architecture Overview

### Data Storage

- Neo4j database for storing workflow data and relationships
- Schema optimized for quick traversal and relationship queries
- Real-time event buffering for performance

### Real-time Updates

- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Event buffering and batching for performance
- Connection recovery and event replay mechanisms

### Visualization Components

- Graph visualization for workflow relationships
- Timeline view for chronological progression
- Interactive node exploration interface
- Analytics dashboard components

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Neo4j Integration

- Set up workflow event schema
- Implement event persistence layer
- Create query optimizations for common paths
- Establish indexing strategy

### 2. Real-time Updates

- WebSocket server implementation
- Event buffering system
- Connection management
- Event replay for missed updates

### 3. Relationship Exploration

- Interactive node selection
- Relationship filtering
- Zoom and pan controls
- Performance optimizations for large graphs

### 4. Analytics Implementation

- Data aggregation pipelines
- Performance metrics collection
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Export functionality

### 5. Intervention System

- Workflow pause mechanisms
- User input handling
- Path redirection logic
- Audit logging

## Performance Considerations

- Batch updates for large workflows
- Lazy loading for historical data
- Client-side caching strategies
- Server-side query optimization

## Security

- Access control for workflow data
- Audit logging for interventions
- Data encryption in transit
- Authentication for WebSocket connections
