## System Overview

Our system is a GitHub-integrated workflow automation platform that converts issues into pull requests using AI assistance. The system consists of four main components:

1. **Web Interface**: A Next.js application providing real-time workflow visualization and control
2. **API Layer**: Handles GitHub integration and coordinates workflow processes
3. **AI Engine**: Manages multiple specialized AI agents for code generation and decision making
4. **Data Storage**: Multi-database system optimized for different data requirements:
   - PostgreSQL for structured data and draft content
   - Neo4j for workflow relationships
   - Redis for real-time state management

### Key Interaction Patterns

1. **Real-time Updates Flow**

   - User action triggers event in Web Interface
   - API Layer processes event and updates state in Redis
   - Changes are propagated to relevant components
   - Web Interface receives updates via SSE

2. **Code Generation Flow**

   - API Layer receives request for code generation
   - AI Engine analyzes requirements
   - Generated code is submitted to GitHub
   - Status updates are stored in Redis
   - Long-term data is persisted to Neo4j

3. **Content Review Flow**

   - User initiates workflow in Web Interface
   - AI Engine generates content
   - Draft content stored in PostgreSQL
   - User reviews content in Web Interface
   - Upon approval, content is published to GitHub
   - Status updates stored in Neo4j
   - Real-time updates via Redis

4. **Monitoring Flow**
   - AI operations are tracked by Langfuse
   - Performance metrics are collected
   - Analytics are made available via dashboard
   - Optimization suggestions are generated

## Observability

The system uses Langfuse for comprehensive AI operation monitoring:

1. **Performance Tracking**

   - Latency monitoring
   - Token usage metrics
   - Success/failure rates

2. **Cost Management**
   - Usage analytics
   - Cost allocation
   - Optimization insights
