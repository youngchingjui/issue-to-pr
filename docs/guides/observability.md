# Observability with Langfuse

## Overview

Our system uses Langfuse's hosted service (cloud.langfuse.com) for monitoring and tracking all LLM operations. This integration provides comprehensive visibility into our AI operations and helps maintain system reliability.

## Monitoring Features

### AI Operation Tracking

- Real-time monitoring of all LLM calls
- Performance metrics for each AI operation
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Success/failure rates across different operations
- Response quality assessment

### Trace Analysis

- End-to-end request tracing for each issue-to-PR conversion
- Visualization of AI decision chains
- Input/output correlation for debugging
- Historical data for operation patterns

### Cost Management

- Detailed token usage tracking per operation
- Cost allocation across different features
- Usage pattern analysis
- Trend monitoring for optimization

## Integration Points

Langfuse is integrated at key points in our system:

1. **Issue Analysis**

   - Tracks initial issue processing
   - Monitors content understanding accuracy

2. **Code Generation**

   - Measures code generation performance
   - Tracks completion rates

3. **PR Creation**
   - Monitors end-to-end conversion success
   - Tracks overall system effectiveness

## Monitoring Dashboard

Our system metrics can be viewed on the Langfuse hosted dashboard, providing:

1. **Real-time Metrics**

   - Current system performance
   - Active operations
   - Recent completions

2. **Historical Analysis**

   - Success rate trends
   - Cost patterns
   - Performance over time

3. **Alert System**
   - Automated monitoring for:
     - High latency operations
     - Increased error rates
     - Cost thresholds
     - Usage spikes

## Key Performance Indicators

1. PR Generation Success Rate
2. Average Processing Time
3. Token Usage per Operation
4. Cost per Successful PR
5. Error Distribution

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**

   - Use descriptive trace names
   - Follow naming conventions for spans
   - Include relevant metadata

2. **Error Handling**

   - Always capture error states
   - Include error context and stack traces
   - Tag critical vs non-critical failures

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor token usage patterns
   - Track response times
   - Identify bottlenecks

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Alerts and Notifications

Configure alerts for:

- High latency operations
- Increased error rates
- Cost thresholds
- Token usage spikes

### Metrics Dashboard

Key metrics to monitor:

1. Success rate of PR generation
2. Average processing time
3. Token usage per operation
4. Cost per successful PR
5. Error distribution by type

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Missing traces

   - Verify API keys
   - Check network connectivity
   - Validate trace initialization

2. Incomplete data
   - Ensure proper trace closure
   - Verify all steps are tracked
   - Check error handling
