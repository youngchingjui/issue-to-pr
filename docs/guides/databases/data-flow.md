# Data Flow Patterns

## Overview

This document describes how data flows through our system, particularly focusing on the interaction between Redis and Neo4j, and how they work together to provide both real-time updates and persistent storage.

## System Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. Store workflow actions/events/messages persistently
2. Support real-time updates and streaming
3. Maintain data consistency across databases
4. Enable efficient querying and retrieval
5. Support concurrent workflows
6. Ensure data durability and reliability

### Performance Requirements

1. Fast real-time event propagation
2. Efficient data synchronization
3. Minimal latency for user interactions
4. Support for high-throughput scenarios
5. Reliable event ordering

## Data Flow Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the complete data flow through our system, showing how Redis handles real-time events while Neo4j provides persistent storage. You can find the full diagram here: [Data Flow Diagram](../../assets/data-flow-diagram.md)

## Event Flow Process

1. **Event Generation**

   - Events created by user actions or system processes
   - Events assigned unique IDs and timestamps
   - Metadata attached for tracking

2. **Real-time Processing**

   - Events immediately published to Redis
   - SSE channels updated
   - Clients receive real-time updates

3. **Persistence Flow**

   - Events queued for Neo4j storage
   - Background process handles persistence
   - Confirmation sent back to Redis

4. **State Synchronization**
   - Regular sync between Redis and Neo4j
   - Consistency checks performed
   - Error handling and recovery

## Implementation Details

### Event Structure

```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string
  timestamp: number
  type: EventType
  payload: any
  metadata: {
    workflowId: string
    userId: string
    source: string
    version: string
  }
}
```

### Data Consistency

```typescript
class DataSynchronizer {
  async syncDatabases() {
    // Get events from Redis queue
    const events = await redis.lrange("persistence:queue", 0, -1)

    // Process each event
    for (const event of events) {
      try {
        // Store in Neo4j
        await neo4j.run(
          `
          MATCH (parent:Node {id: $parentId})
          CREATE (n:Node {
            id: $id,
            workflow_id: $workflowId,
            type: $type,
            content: $content,
            metadata: $metadata,
            timestamp: datetime()
          })
          CREATE (parent)-[:PARENT_OF]->(n)
          `,
          event
        )

        // Remove from Redis queue
        await redis.lrem("persistence:queue", 1, JSON.stringify(event))
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle error and retry logic
        await this.handleSyncError(event, error)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Types of Errors

1. **Temporary Failures**

   - Network issues
   - Database timeouts
   - Resource constraints

2. **Data Inconsistencies**
   - Missing events
   - Duplicate events
   - Order mismatches

### Recovery Strategies

1. **Automatic Recovery**

   - Retry mechanisms
   - Event reprocessing
   - State reconstruction

2. **Manual Intervention**
   - Admin tools
   - Data repair scripts
   - Audit logging

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics

1. **Performance Metrics**

   - Event processing time
   - Database sync latency
   - Queue lengths
   - Error rates

2. **Health Checks**
   - Database connectivity
   - Queue health
   - System resource usage
   - Data consistency

### Maintenance Tasks

1. **Regular Tasks**

   - Queue cleanup
   - Data archival
   - Performance optimization
   - Consistency checks

2. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Error recovery
   - Data restoration
   - System rollback
