# Workflow Visualization User Stories

This document outlines the user stories for the workflow visualization feature, which allows users to understand and interact with the LLM agent workflows in the system.

## Core User Stories

### 1. Viewing Workflow History

**As a** user  
**I want to** see a visual representation of the workflow steps that have been executed  
**So that** I can understand how the LLM agent processed my request

Acceptance Criteria:

- User can see a chronological list of events in the workflow
- Each event shows its type (message, tool call, decision point)
- Events are connected to show their relationships
- Timestamps are displayed for each event
- The current status of the workflow is clearly indicated

### 2. Understanding Agent Decisions

**As a** user  
**I want to** see the reasoning behind each agent's decision  
**So that** I can understand why certain actions were taken

Acceptance Criteria:

- Each decision point shows the agent's thought process
- Alternative paths that were considered are visible
- The factors that influenced the decision are displayed
- Links between decisions and resulting actions are clear
- Users can expand/collapse detailed reasoning

### 3. Exploring Node Relationships

**As a** user  
**I want to** explore how different nodes in the workflow relate to each other  
**So that** I can understand the complex interactions in the system

Acceptance Criteria:

- Users can click on nodes to see their relationships
- Different types of relationships are visually distinct
- Users can filter relationships by type
- The direction of relationships is clearly shown
- Users can zoom in/out of the relationship view

### 4. Real-time Workflow Updates

**As a** user  
**I want to** see the workflow update in real-time as the agent works  
**So that** I can monitor progress and understand what's happening

Acceptance Criteria:

- New nodes appear immediately when created
- Current active node is highlighted
- Users can see when new relationships are formed
- Status changes are reflected in real-time
- Users can tell if a workflow is active or completed

## Future Considerations

### 5. Workflow Analytics

**As a** user  
**I want to** see analytics about workflow patterns and performance  
**So that** I can optimize and improve the system

Acceptance Criteria:

- View common paths through workflows
- See timing statistics for different steps
- Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies
- Compare performance across different workflows
- Export analytics data for further analysis

### 6. Workflow Intervention

**As a** user  
**I want to** be able to intervene in active workflows when needed  
**So that** I can guide or correct the agent's actions

Acceptance Criteria:

- Ability to pause workflows at decision points
- Option to provide additional input to agents
- Capability to redirect workflow paths
- Clear indication of manual interventions in the visualization
- Audit trail of user interventions

## Technical Considerations

- Integration with Neo4j for storing and querying workflow data
- Real-time updates using WebSocket connections
- Scalable visualization for complex workflows
- Performance optimization for large workflow graphs
- Security considerations for workflow data access

## Next Steps

1. Implement basic workflow visualization with Neo4j integration
2. Add real-time update capabilities
3. Develop the relationship exploration interface
4. Create analytics dashboard
5. Build intervention capabilities
