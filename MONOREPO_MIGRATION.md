# Monorepo Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the issue-to-pr application from a single Next.js app to a monorepo architecture with separate services.

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ 1. Monorepo Structure Setup
- Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for workspace management
- Updated root `package.json` with workspace configuration
- Created proper folder structure for services

### ‚úÖ 2. Shared Library Creation
- **Location**: `services/shared/`
- **Contents**: 
  - Common types and Zod schemas
  - Database utilities (Redis, Neo4j)
  - GitHub API types
  - Job data schemas
- **Built and tested**: Compiles successfully

### ‚úÖ 3. Worker Service Implementation
- **Location**: `services/worker/`
- **Features**:
  - BullMQ integration for job processing
  - Three job queues: resolve-issue, comment-on-issue, auto-resolve-issue
  - Configurable concurrency levels
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Health checks
- **Status**: Running successfully in Docker

### ‚úÖ 4. Queue System Integration
- Replaced direct workflow execution with job enqueueing
- Updated API routes: `/api/resolve`, `/api/comment`, `/api/workflow/autoResolveIssue`
- Jobs now process asynchronously in worker service
- Maintains backward compatibility for API consumers

### ‚úÖ 5. Docker Configuration
- Added worker service to Docker Compose
- Created `docker/compose/worker.yml`
- Updated networking configuration
- Added health checks and restart policies

### ‚úÖ 6. TypeScript Configuration
- Updated main `tsconfig.json` to recognize shared module
- Proper path mapping for shared library imports
- All services compile without errors

## Benefits Achieved

### üöÄ Scalability
- Worker service can be scaled independently
- Queue-based processing handles load spikes
- Multiple worker instances can run simultaneously

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability
- Web app crashes don't affect background jobs
- Jobs are persisted in Redis queues
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed jobs

### üîß Development Experience
- Shared types ensure consistency across services
- Independent development and testing
- Clear separation of concerns

## Services Status

### Next.js Application
- ‚úÖ Running (existing functionality maintained)
- ‚úÖ API routes updated to use queue system
- ‚úÖ Imports shared library successfully

### Worker Service
- ‚úÖ Built and running in Docker
- ‚úÖ Connected to Redis
- ‚úÖ Listening on all three job queues
- ‚úÖ Health checks passing

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Redis: Healthy and accessible
- ‚úÖ Neo4j: Running (existing setup)
- ‚úÖ Docker networking: Configured properly

## Technical Details

### Queue Configuration
```
resolve-issue: 2 concurrent jobs
comment-on-issue: 3 concurrent jobs  
auto-resolve-issue: 1 concurrent job
```

### Job Flow
1. API receives request ‚Üí validates data ‚Üí enqueues job
2. Worker picks up job ‚Üí processes workflow ‚Üí updates database
3. Results stored in Neo4j, status via existing SSE system

### Dependencies Added
- `bullmq`: Job queue processing
- `ioredis`: Redis client (BullMQ requirement)
- `tsx`: Development tooling

## Next Steps

### For Production Deployment
1. Set up environment variables for production
2. Configure managed Redis service (Upstash)
3. Set up worker scaling policies
4. Monitor queue metrics

### For Development
1. All services are ready for development
2. Use `pnpm dev:worker` for worker development
3. Use existing `pnpm dev` for Next.js development

### Future Enhancements
- Add queue monitoring dashboard
- Implement job priority levels
- Add more granular error handling
- Consider adding more specialized worker types

## Migration Impact

### ‚úÖ Zero Breaking Changes
- All existing API endpoints work the same
- Same response formats
- Same authentication/authorization

### ‚úÖ Performance Improvements
- Background jobs no longer block HTTP responses
- Better resource utilization
- Improved error isolation

### ‚úÖ Operational Benefits
- Independent service scaling
- Better monitoring capabilities
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Next.js app
pnpm dev:worker       # Worker service
pnpm build:shared     # Build shared library

# Docker
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d    # Start all services
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps       # Check status
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs worker  # Worker logs

# Building
pnpm build:all        # Build all services
```

This migration successfully transforms the application into a scalable, reliable, and maintainable monorepo architecture while preserving all existing functionality.
