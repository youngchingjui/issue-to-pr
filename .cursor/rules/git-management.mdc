## Git Management Rules

### File Operations
- Always use `git mv` instead of regular `mv` when moving or renaming files
- This ensures Git properly tracks file history
- Example: `git mv old_file.txt new_file.txt`

### Commits
- Do not make commits directly through the AI assistant
- Let the user handle all git operations (commits, pushes, etc.)
- Only suggest git commands if explicitly requested by the user

### Pull Requests
- Can create and update pull requests through GitHub API when requested
- Do not automatically merge pull requests
- Let the user handle the actual code review process
