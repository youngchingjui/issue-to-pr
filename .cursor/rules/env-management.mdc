## Environment Variables Management
- All environment variables are managed through Vercel
- Use `vercel env pull` to sync environment variables locally
- Add new variables using `vercel env add [name] [environment]`
- Remove variables using `vercel env rm [name] [environment]`
- Never commit sensitive environment variables to the repository
- Always use environment-specific variables (development, preview, production)
