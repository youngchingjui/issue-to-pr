 # Code Structure Reference

When searching for existing files or determining where to create new files:

1. **Refer to `/docs/code-structure.md`** for:
   - Understanding the project's directory structure
   - Finding the appropriate location for new files
   - Locating existing functionality
   - Following code organization patterns

2. **Before creating new files:**
   - Search existing directories as documented in the structure
   - Verify similar functionality doesn't already exist

This will help maintain consistency and prevent duplicate implementations.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Avoid Barrel Files**: Do not create files whose sole purpose is to re-export symbols from multiple modules. Prefer importing from the original module paths to maintain clear dependency graphs. Barrel files cause compile and build times to increase dramatically, and reduce tree-shaking capabilities.
