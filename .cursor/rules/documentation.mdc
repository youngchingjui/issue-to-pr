 # Documentation Management

## File Organization
- All documentation should be organized within the `/docs` directory
- Documentation should be broken down into logical, focused files
- Each documentation file should cover a single topic or component
- Large documentation files should be split into smaller, more manageable pieces
- Use meaningful file names that clearly indicate the content

## Structure Guidelines
- Maximum recommended file size: 500 lines
- Use clear headings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3)
- Cross-reference related documentation files when appropriate

## Content Requirements
- Each major feature or component should have its own documentation file
- Do NOT include code examples.
- Document API endpoints, parameters, and responses
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Include setup and installation instructions in the root README.md

## File Types
- Use Markdown (.md) for documentation files
- Place diagrams and images in a `/docs/assets` subdirectory
- Maintain a consistent style across all documentation files

## Organization Pattern
```
/docs
  /api          # API documentation
  /components   # Component documentation
  /guides      # User and developer guides
  /assets      # Images and diagrams
  /setup       # Installation and configuration
```
