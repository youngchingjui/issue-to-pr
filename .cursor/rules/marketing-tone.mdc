# Marketing Writing Tone

When working on marketing tasks (blog posts, documentation, website copy, product descriptions, etc.), use this tone:

## Tone Characteristics

**Professional and Matter-of-Fact**: State capabilities clearly without overselling or marketing hype.

**Direct and Informative**: Focus on functionality and practical benefits. Lead with what the tool actually does rather than emotional appeals.

**Technical but Accessible**: Use precise technical terms but explain them in plain language that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand.

**Confident without Boastful**: Present features as established facts rather than promises or marketing claims. Use definitive language like "Issue To PR immediately generates" rather than "Issue To PR can help you..."

**Solution-Focused**: Emphasize practical benefits and workflow improvements rather than competitive positioning or feature comparisons.

**Respectful of Audience Expertise**: Acknowledge that the audience (typically developers) are skilled professionals who remain in control of important decisions.

## Reference Example

This tone is exemplified in `/blogs/whyIssueToPR.md`, particularly in lines like:

"When you have a GitHub issue, Issue To PR reads the problem description, analyzes your repository to understand the codebase structure, identifies the files that need changes, implements the fix, runs tests, and creates a pull request with detailed explanations."

## What to Avoid

- Marketing jargon and buzzwords
- Excessive enthusiasm or hyperbole  
- Vague promises or claims
- Talking down to the audience
- Feature lists without clear practical benefits
