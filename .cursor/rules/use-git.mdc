Whenever working on a new update, be sure to synchronize information both locally with .git and the Issues and PRs on Github.

Identify if there are any existing issues on Github that are related. If so, checkout that issue to work on.

Be sure any new branches are made from the latest `main` branch.

Don't make pull requests until I explicitly ask to.
